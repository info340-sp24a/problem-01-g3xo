My Melody 
My Melody is a character in Hello Kitty. 
She was born in the forest of Mariland. Her favorite hobby is baking cookies with her mother, and her favorite food is almond pound cake. She enjoys eating cake with her best friend, a mouse named Flat.

I admire My Melody because she is super cute, has a kind personality, and is independent.
